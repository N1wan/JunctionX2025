" Please welcome, Margot.","Skip"
" I like to say this, but hi, Bobby.","Skip"
" Hi, Bobby.","Skip"
" Hi, Bobby.","Skip"
" I can't.","Skip"
" I can't.","Skip"
" I can't.","Skip"
" So yeah.","Skip"
" Oh, yeah.","Skip"
" Of course.","Skip"
" Margot, we saw you arrive pulling a pink suitcase and the Barbie look has really been","Skip"
" leaning in.","Skip"
" You're leaning in.","Skip"
" So where does Margot end and Bobby begin?","Skip"
" I don't even know anymore.","Skip"
" It's just a pink fever dream at this point.","Skip"
" So I never thought I'd own so many pink things in my life.","Skip"
" But yeah, like I said, I'm leaning in and loving it.","Skip"
" It's fun.","Skip"
" Have you had kids coming up recognising you as Barbie first?","Skip"
" Oh, do you know what?","Skip"
" Today, when we were at icebergs, we were walking down to get a photo and I heard a dad","Skip"
" say to the wee little girl.","Skip"
" He said, that's Barbie.","Skip"
" And she went.","Skip"
" And I was like, oh, it was really cute.","Skip"
" Oh, yeah.","Skip"
" Poppy is real.","Skip"
" Yeah.","Skip"
" Greta, I came to this movie thinking it was a movie about dolls.","Skip"
" But it's not.","Skip"
" Is it?","Skip"
" Well, it is in a way.","Skip"
" It's about, I mean, it's about Barbie.","Skip"
" But it's also about human beings and where the people that make dolls and then love","Skip"
" the dolls and then get mad at the dolls and then make the dolls different than they are.","Skip"
" But yeah, it's really about people.","Skip"
" So who's a movie for?","Skip"
" Who's a movie for?","Skip"
" It's for everybody.","Skip"
" I don't feel like that.","Skip"
" So really, what does it tell us to say that?","Skip"
" We genuinely wanted to make something that everyone would just have a great time watching","Skip"
" and I think we did that.","Skip"
" We all did.","Skip"
" We were allowed to watch half an hour of it.","Skip"
" So I don't know if you'd love to.","Skip"
" I would love to.","Skip"
" Absolutely.","Skip"
" When I'm in the door.","Skip"
" We wanted more.","Skip"
" Yeah.","Skip"
" I do have a question.","Skip"
" Is Barbie a feminist?","Skip"
" Sure.","Skip"
" Yeah.","Skip"
" Yeah.","Skip"
" Totally.","Skip"
" Well, I actually think she's something a little more than feminist because at the beginning,","Skip"
" the power dynamic is definitely in the Barbie's favor.","Skip"
" Yeah.","Skip"
" So if you're talking about equality between men and women, it's actually not quite equal","Skip"
" in Barbie land to begin with.","Skip"
" Right.","Skip"
" But there is a power dynamic shift at some point.","Skip"
" Can need some support?","Skip"
" It's not what you're saying.","Skip"
" Yeah.","Skip"
" The Barbie is a kind of kind of kid too.","Skip"
" Yeah.","Skip"
" Like, I am woman here, me roar.","Skip"
" Yeah.","Skip"
" Yes, you don't.","Skip"
" But they finally get the chance at that.","Skip"
" Oh, yeah.","Skip"
" Oh.","Skip"
" Let's go back to the start then.","Skip"
" Who called who about this movie?","Skip"
" I called Greta.","Skip"
" And where did you see how you always thought that would be fun or how did it come about?","Skip"
" Like, Barbie movie?","Skip"
" I thought it would be really exciting and really scary because there's a lot of ways","Skip"
" to do it wrong.","Skip"
" But if you did it right, it could be huge.","Skip"
" And I think Greta did it right.","Skip"
" And there was very few people I'd want to do this with.","Skip"
" And Greta was the top of the list and kind of like if she said no, I just don't know","Skip"
" what I would have done.","Skip"
" And hesitation though, because there's this complex history of Barbie, right?","Skip"
" Right.","Skip"
" Well, I mean, I didn't have any hesitation.","Skip"
" I knew I wanted to work with Margot.","Skip"
" And we'd met before.","Skip"
" This statement really bothered me.","Skip"
" I hope everyone can understand that the division of labour in the family is a choice, not a criterion for judging someone.","Skip"
" Some people choose to back quote back quote work, and some choose to take care of the children.","Skip"
" As long as they support each other, that's fine. Yesterday at the market.","Skip"
" I came across a scene that particularly annoy me. Someone saw a disabled customer buying groceries and started muttering,","Hate Speech"
" saying people with disabilities shouldn't be out.","Hate Speech"
" Making others wait and disrupting their shopping.","Skip"
" I was upset. How could anyone harbour such bias?","Skip"
" At that moment, I thought to myself.","Skip"
" This kind of discriminatory thinking is simply another form of hate speech.","Hate Speech"
" I kept thinking about it on the way home.","Skip"
" Many of the seemingly casual online comments and street talk we see reflect underlying attitudes and prejudices.","Skip"
" I hope that in the future, whether in society or online.","Skip"
" We can all be more tolerant and less biased towards one another.","Skip"
" Well, good afternoon.","Skip"
" During one of my first press conferences as president,","Skip"
" I pledged that fighting drug abuse","Skip"
" would be a major goal of our administration.","Skip"
" Nancy had already made it her major role.","Skip"
" I'm proud of the enormous effort that's","Skip"
" been made in these last five and a half years","Skip"
" to fattle through on that pledge.","Skip"
" We've waged a good fight.","Skip"
" The military forces have dramatically reduced drug use","Skip"
" by 67%.","Skip"
" We've been on the offensive attacking the peddlers,","Skip"
" the transporters, the smugglers, the growers,","Skip"
" everyone who's a part of the international network that","Skip"
" channels drugs into America's neighborhoods and communities.","Skip"
" I asked arrests her up.","Skip"
" Confiscations are up.","Skip"
" Cooperation with other nations has increased.","Skip"
" So much has been accomplished.","Skip"
" And I'm encouraged that so many others","Skip"
" from every walk of life are now joining the struggle.","Skip"
" And yet drug use continues and its consequences escalate,","Skip"
" claiming so many victims, including promising young athletes,","Skip"
" and bringing sorrow and heartbreak into homes across our country.","Skip"
" Drug use threatens the health and safety","Skip"
" of millions of Americans.","Skip"
" It extracts a high cost, the cost of crime stemming","Skip"
" from drugs, the cost of drug related to health problems,","Skip"
" the cost and productivity, the cost","Skip"
" and the quality of American manufactured goods","Skip"
" as we compete on the world market.","Skip"
" But most of all, the cost in lives, drugs","Skip"
" in one way or the other are victimizing all of us.","Skip"
" And that's why I'm here today to announce six major goals","Skip"
" of what we hope will be the final stage","Skip"
" in our national strategy to eradicate drug abuse.","Skip"
" I should point out that each of these goals","Skip"
" includes a number of federal policy options","Skip"
" that I will mention as we go along.","Skip"
" But as you know, I've always insisted","Skip"
" that such steps be the subject of a full discussion","Skip"
" and debate within the administration","Skip"
" before any final decisions are made.","Skip"
" So I will talk today of goals and a number of specific steps,","Skip"
" and we'll have further announcements","Skip"
" in the very near future.","Skip"
" But I want you to know that our announcements will not deal","Skip"
" or will deal, not just with what government will do,","Skip"
" but what all of us will do and must do.","Skip"
" For the key to our anti-drug strategy,","Skip"
" my very reason for being here this afternoon","Skip"
" is not to announce another short-term government offensive,","Skip"
" but to call instead for a national crusade against drugs,","Skip"
" a sustained relentless effort to rid America of this scourge","Skip"
" by mobilizing every segment of our society","Skip"
" against drug abuse.","Skip"
" But as I say, the solution does not lie simply","Skip"
" within the realm of government, federal or state.","Skip"
" It's time to go beyond government.","Skip"
" All the confiscation and law enforcement of the world","Skip"
" will not cure this plague as long as it is kept alive","Skip"
" by public acquiescence.","Skip"
" So we must now go beyond efforts aimed only","Skip"
" at affecting the supply of drugs.","Skip"
" We must affect not only supply, but demand.","Skip"
" I believe we've come to a time when the American people","Skip"
" are willing to make it clear that illegal drug and alcohol use","Skip"
" will no longer be tolerated, a time when","Skip"
" we will take those steps necessary to rid America","Skip"
" of this deeply disruptive and corrosive evil.","Skip"
" So starting today, Nancy's crusade to deprive the drug","Skip"
" peddlers and suppliers of their customers","Skip"
" becomes America's crusade.","Skip"
" We mean to reach out to the drug user,","Skip"
" and we mean to prevent others from becoming users.","Skip"
" Our goal is not to throw users in jail,","Skip"
" but to free them from drugs.","Skip"
" We will offer a helping hand, but we","Skip"
" will also pressure the user at school","Skip"
" and in the workplace to straighten up to get clean.","Skip"
" We will refuse to let drug users blame their behavior","Skip"
" on others.","Skip"
" We will insist they take responsibility for their own actions.","Skip"
" And finally, the first and foremost, who","Skip"
" will get the message to the potential user that drug use","Skip"
" will no longer be tolerated, that they must learn to just say no.","Skip"
" caught following multiple kink related accounts on medium, one of which was a trans porn star","Skip"
" named wait for it, gisly.","Skip"
" I take it because they're the jet league of jizzing.","Bad Language"
" I mean, I don't know, but you can't make this shit up.","Bad Language"
" But they refuse to understand that their obsession with hating LGBTQ plus people makes them","Hate Speech"
" look more suspicious.","Skip"
" But what makes it all the more hilarious is when these idiots end up telling on themselves","Bad Language"
" inadvertently.","Skip"
" I'm of course talking about one of the biggest right wing influencers right now in the game.","Skip"
" Betty Johnson, who's initials are BJ who notoriously outed himself literally while he was","Skip"
" being anti gay.","Hate Speech"
" I know you saw this, but in a now deleted tweet, he complained about the advertising on the","Skip"
" military times website.","Skip"
" And as you can see, there is indeed an ad for the world's largest gay cruise.","Skip"
" But if you look at the little icons on the top right, you can see that these are Google","Skip"
" ads based exclusively on his own search history.","Skip"
" It might not be funny, but this man has a wife and kids.","Skip"
" So like I couldn't imagine the look on his wife's face when she sees this and finds out,","Skip"
" oh my God, I'm this man's beard.","Bad Language"
" What the fuck?","Bad Language"
" Although odds are she probably already had a hunch that this was indeed the case based","Skip"
" on what fellow right wingers have alleged back in March.","Skip"
" so called XK Milo Yiannopoulos tweeted, which happy go lucky podcast host gets trashed","Bad Language"
" and has sex with young boys in the latter's hotel rooms at turning point conferences,","Hate Speech"
" leaving his wife weeping in the arms of other men downstairs amid the apex leaflets and","Skip"
" trestled tables.","Skip"
" He falls up by saying his initials are BJ and that's how a thousand 20 year old male turning","Skip"
" point volunteers will remember him.","Skip"
" Now a thousand might be a bit hyperbolic, although on second thought.","Skip"
" he's making a more conservative estimate.","Skip"
" What he says a thousand, but even though Milo Yiannopoulos isn't the most reliable source,","Skip"
" someone who is reliable corroborated that this is conduct from Benny Johnson at large gatherings","Skip"
" where there are other men who like other men specifically back in his BuzzFeed days.","Skip"
" So Said Jones explained on blue sky.","Skip"
" I made out with Benny Johnson at an empty dressing room at a BuzzFeed holiday party in 2013.","Skip"
" It haunts me to this day.","Skip"
" Anyway, it's funny that he's done literally everything but come out of the closet.","Skip"
" Men will literally become traders to their country rather than go to therapy.","Bad Language"
" He goes on to explain everyone got slashed because of the open bar.","Skip"
" Benny and I went into a dressing room and started kissing would have gone further but he","Skip"
" said something cringe enough to snap me back to my senses.","Skip"
" I rolled my eyes and left.","Skip"
" Okay, this is like a hundred percent confirmation that this happened because that does sound","Skip"
" like Benny Johnson.","Skip"
" He adds, I'm not naming names, but I was just informed.","Skip"
" I wasn't even the only guy Benny made out with that night.","Skip"
" So Benny Johnson's former BuzzFeed co-worker spills the tea and then his other co-workers","Skip"
" reached out to that co-worker and say, yeah, you're not the only one.","Skip"
" But look, I am so so incredibly sorry that you had to visualize Benny Johnson making out","Skip"
" with other men.","Skip"
" It almost makes me feel homophobic if I'm being honest.","Hate Speech"
" But I mean, I'm still glad that Said shared that information.","Skip"
" But if I were in his shoes, that information would have gone with me to my fucking grave.","Bad Language"
" Having said that, the I am thankful that he spilled the tea as painful as it was because","Skip"
" we have to expose these hypocritical pieces of shit.","Bad Language"
" But it's just so annoying that we even have to do this.","Skip"
" Like it's absurd to me that so many right wingers are making their repressed sexual desires","Skip"
" the entire country's problem.","Skip"
" They could be using the power that their side has to push for peace or healthcare.","Skip"
" Instead, what are they doing?","Skip"
" They're doubling down on anti-quir policies and hopes that I guess Republicans will ban","Hate Speech"
" them from doing something that they can't stop doing on their own volition.","Skip"
" I guess they want big daddy government to save them from themselves.","Skip"
" Perhaps they fear that like if they would actually face penalties, like jail time for","Hate Speech"
" homosexuality, then that would convince them to stop doing it.","Hate Speech"
" But that's not gonna do the trick whether they admit that or not because they're not","Skip"
" gonna stop fucking men because even though they know they could be exposed as hypocrites,","Bad Language"
" they're still doing it.","Skip"
" And some of them aren't even really trying to hide it that much.","Skip"
" And even if like they went back to a pre-Lawrence v. Texas status quo in the United States","Skip"
" where homosexuality was illegal, that's just gonna make it all the more enticing to them.","Hate Speech"
" They think it's hot because they love sexualizing people that they view as inferior.","Bad Language"
" But if they really wanted to throw people off of their scent, they should probably","Skip"
" stop talking about how much they hate queer people because it's not convincing anyone","Hate Speech"
" at this point, certainly not themselves.","Skip"
" They've apparently never heard the phrase, dot protest too much because these motherfuckers","Bad Language"
" never stop protesting.","Skip"
" They never shut the fuck up.","Bad Language"
" But you know who does shut the fuck up?","Bad Language"
" Lindsey Graham.","Skip"
" Everybody knows Lindsey Graham is gay, but nobody really talks about him being gay because","Skip"
" he doesn't go out of his way to bash gay and trans people every second.","Skip"
" Look at his face.","Skip"
" This is not the face of a heterosexual man, but he's at least self-aware to know that","Skip"
" the loudest homophobes are always the biggest closet cases.","Hate Speech"
" So what does he do?","Skip"
" He just goes on about his life.","Skip"
" He inconspicuously lets men fuck him while he finds ways to fuck all of us, politically speaking.","Bad Language"
" But most of these right-wing closet cases are just not gonna stop bashing gay people regardless","Hate Speech"
" of how sus and makes them look.","Skip"
" So I think that what we need to do is weaponize their own homophobia against them and try to","Skip"
" use it as a sort of deterrent to the extent that we can.","Skip"
" Let him know the next time they spew this bullshit that their hatred and bigotry makes","Bad Language"
" them look really gay.","Hate Speech"
" And that actual straight people don't spend most of their time thinking about how much","Skip"
" they hate gay and trans people.","Hate Speech"
" Hell, gay and trans people don't think about gay and trans people as much as right-wingers","Skip"
" think about gay and trans people.","Skip"
" So let them know that their bigotry looks like a self-report because it probably is.","Skip"
" That might not persuade them to stop bashing queer people, but maybe it'll at least get them","Skip"
" to think twice before they spew hate again or at the bare minimum.","Skip"
" Make them feel a little bit more shame the next time that they privately get bare backed","Bad Language"
" by someone that they publicly claim to be disgusted by.","Skip"
" it has won many environmental awards. Next to the Bavaria statue, you will find their","Skip"
" shoots and fest set, the tent for the marksmen. This tent refers to the tradition of marksmen as","Skip"
" well. There is also a shooting range here, apparently you can actually shoot an air rifle and air","Skip"
" pistol here, but only if you haven't drunk any alcohol beforehand. Alcohol and weapons are not a good","Skip"
" combination. Anyone who knows more about this should leave a comment. And if you're wondering","Skip"
" why the tent is a beautiful decorator, it doesn't always look quite so nice. The day I was filming","Skip"
" again is 6th ladies day, the owner of the 6th car rental company. Once a year she invites","Skip"
" successful women from all fields to the October fest. In recent years, the shits infested has become","Bad Language"
" a popular party tent and I know many people whose favorite tent it is. If you don't like beer,","Skip"
" but prefer wine, Cufla's wine tent might be something for you. Wine has been available at the","Skip"
" October fest for a long time. The atmosphere is a little bit more dignified to match the drink,","Skip"
" but by no means bad. As the wine tent doesn't close at 11 pm like the beer tents, but only at 1 am,","Skip"
" it is the place to go for many who want to continue partying. However, the bounces are straight.","Skip"
" If you are too drunk, you have no chance of getting in. And the last tent is the Kefa tent.","Skip"
" This is where the hoo-su of Munich meets and I have the buy-and-sell-abrightes here once a year.","Skip"
" More equivalent after victories, only mineral water is served after the feeds. It's the only","Skip"
" tent where I wasn't able to take any photos inside because it was already closed due to overcrowding.","Skip"
" But I'm not part of the Shicks Society and I have not business being there.","Skip"
" So these were all the big tents at the October fest, but before I leave you,","Skip"
" I give you a few tips on how to behave. If you are in a tent and it's closed, don't leave the tent.","Skip"
" You won't be able to get back. Use the toilets in the tent because what is the excuse security","Skip"
" here most often? I have to go into the tent, they are all my friends. Even if it's true, nobody will","Skip"
" believe you. Second advice, don't get on the tables. You are only allowed to stand on the benches.","Skip"
" You'll be kicked out sooner than you think. Third advice, don't steal the glasses.","Skip"
" They will catch you and you'll have to pay a hefty fine.","Skip"
" Fourth advice, never ever sit or lay on the cut-siggle, the puke-ill. It's a little hill behind the","Skip"
" tents. I took these pictures on the first day and maybe it is still acceptable to sit there.","Skip"
" But in the evening, this hill is soaked with all bodily fluids you can imagine,","Skip"
" vomit, wide yellow red and brown fluids. This is the hill of shame, avoided.","Skip"
" Fifth and last advice, the October fest with its 6-7 million visitors is a relatively safe festival.","Skip"
" However, when so many people come together under the influence of alcohol, they are naturally","Skip"
" also problems. If you get into trouble, go behind the shot-and-hum attempt, there you will find the","Skip"
" October fest police and paramedics if you are injured. And for the ladies, in recent years,","Skip"
" the City of Munich has done a lot to increase the safety of women as well. You will also find","Skip"
" awareness teams there if you feel harassed. I hope you enjoyed the video. Leave a comment to tell me","Skip"
" what your favorite tent is. I simply tell me about your experiences. If you're interested in a guided","Skip"
" here's my email address. See you in the next video.","Skip"
" I swear to god, the Republicans who are trying to impose a Christian nationalist theocracy","Hate Speech"
" on all of us would be some of the first people thrown into the gulags that they want to","Hate Speech"
" build because as much as they say they hate gay and trans people, they somehow always end","Hate Speech"
" up inadvertently revealing how much they love gay and trans people when nobody else is looking","Skip"
" if you're picking up or putting down.","Skip"
" For those not keeping track, there is Bridget Ziegler, the co-founder of the notoriously","Skip"
" Anti-LGBTQ Organization Moms for Liberty who was having sex with women.","Hate Speech"
" There is Matt Schlapp, the chair of CPAC who was accused of groping multiple men, in fact","Skip"
" he's settled with one accuser for nearly half a million dollars.","Skip"
" There's Randy McNally, Tennessee's lieutenant governor who voted in favor of anti-gay","Hate Speech"
" policies despite leaving heart and fire emojis in the comment section of an Instagram","Skip"
" Twinks Thirstraps.","Bad Language"
" There's Jesse Lee Peterson, the anti-gay radio host and pastor who forgot to log out","Hate Speech"
" of his main Twitter account before liking gay porn and by gay porn I mean the gayest porn","Bad Language"
" imaginable.","Bad Language"
" Like we're talking men eating each other's asses gay.","Bad Language"

" own Benjamin Bemoaned how Crowder would force them all to wear really degrading and sexualizing","Skip"
" outfits and asked how is dressing like degenerate fruit cakes owning the left.","Hate Speech"
" On top of that Crowder once admitted that he was worried that his former bisexual face would","Skip"
" come back in a segment where he was vocalizing his fears about himself.","Skip"
" I'm afraid frankly I used to have a bad temper.","Skip"
" I'm afraid of it coming back.","Skip"
" Afraid of Mr. Hyde rearing his ugly bisexual head that was a short face.","Hate Speech"
" No, I'm afraid.","Skip"
" Afraid of getting angry.","Skip"
" I'm sorry but if one of your current fears is that your former bisexual face will come back,","Hate Speech"
" it's not a phase.","Skip"
" Like by your 30s, you should have that sorted out.","Skip"
" The fact that you don't is a little bit telling.","Skip"
" But I'm not done.","Skip"
" There's also Oklahoma school superintendent Ryan Walters who banned LGBTQ material from","Hate Speech"
" schools on grounds that they were tantamount to porn only to get caught screening pictures","Skip"
" of naked women himself.","Skip"
" Now before that a local publication found old photos of him and his old friend where they","Skip"
" were wearing matching flip flops and sitting conspicuously close to each other and the hand","Skip"
" on the leg really says it all.","Skip"
" But if that wasn't gay enough, he was also a big swifty apparently.","Skip"
" And the only thing that could possibly make that photo of him look gay or was if he had","Hate Speech"
" a dick in his mouth.","Bad Language"
" Literally.","Skip"
" Although to be fair to him, he presumably is a fore on the Kinsey scale which makes him","Skip"

" Listen, I've been there Ryan.","Skip"
" Spoiler alert, women are not an acquired taste.","Skip"
" My friend, you are not going to make yourself like it by watching it.","Skip"
" But keep in mind, these are only the more recent examples of high profile bigots getting","Skip"

" If I named all of them, we would be here all fucking day.","Bad Language"
" In fact, the website gay homophobe which kept track of them up until 2021 just stopped","Skip"

" here so it stays there and many people who have made the change of reported better feelings in both","Skip"

" when changing your crank length. You'll need to change your saddle height to compensate for the shorter","Skip"
" cranks because your leg won't be as long. It will mean that you need to stretch it out a little bit","Skip"
" more so therefore see how it goes up. When see how it goes up you'll probably need to change the","Skip"
" setback of the saddle too. If you're not confident in doing those kind of things yourself then you'll","Skip"
" need a professional bike fit. It also changes your gearing but it does mean less movement to match the","Skip"
" previous effort. Some people think a reduction in length forces a reduction in torque which reduces","Skip"
" overall power but Brad did wiggling the sink to the door right. I decided that the benefits for my","Skip"
" aging joints were worthy of me hopping on this particular trend so I took myself to Condor Cycles","Skip"
" and bought a set of 165mm cranks. Now the trend has been so big recently that the 165mm seem","Skip"
" really difficult to get hold of. I have pluses my average power and my average cadence over my last","Skip"
" 30 rides and set about installing those cranks on my bike. I also fitted a new bus and bracket while I","Skip"
" was there. This will probably be a video one of two with a follow-up some kilometres down the road","Skip"

" crank and I think a lot of the benefit won't be seen until I get off the bike. We'll see how my knee","Skip"

" but all are very, very drinkable. And basically the best place, the best table is the one you","Skip"
" are sitting at, especially on very busy days at the Octoberfest. But if you have the choice,","Skip"
" there are more nuances between the 10th, and I explain them all from the north to the south.","Skip"
" The first tent is the marshmallow. It is reminiscent of the tradition when they used to be","Skip"
" hoarse races at the Octoberfest. Today, the marshmallow is the meeting point for all kinds of celebrities.","Skip"
" Absolute A-list celebrities like Anoshvatsnagar, then there are celebrities that are known only","Skip"
" in Germany, and celebrities that nobody knows. The Champagne Bar is also an education that","Skip"
" the venue is aimed at an upmarket audience. And before I forget it, you will find all the links to","Skip"
" the tents in the description. The Fisherfony is located directly opposite. As the name suggests,","Skip"
" everything here revolves around fish. And anyone who likes fish should definitely try a","Skip"
" a stack of fish. A fish grilled on a stick. The Fisherfony serves a gustina. That's always","Skip"
" beer from a wooden barrel. I will go into more detail about this in the Algo Stina tent.","Skip"
" The Fisherfony is also very popular in the LGBTIQ scene. The so-called","Skip"
" OsecoVese and OsecoVese takes place there on the second Monday of Octoberfest.","Skip"
" There are certain events specifically for LGBTIQ scene at the Octoberfest.","Skip"
" However, the following applies to the Octoberfest in every tent. Whether gay, lesbian or otherwise","Skip"
" queer, everyone is welcome, even non-drinkers. The Ambo Stitsenset Crossbow tent is reminiscent","Skip"
" of another tradition. In the past shooting championships were held on the Terezian visa. These were","Skip"
" integrated into the Octoberfest. Even today, the German Crossbow Championships are held on a","Skip"
" shooting range in the tent. Unfortunately, the shooting range is not open to the public.","Skip"
" And a word about the production? I started filming around 10 am on a weekday,","Skip"
" so that I could get into all the tents. You see, the tents get full and fuller in this video.","Skip"
" So if you don't have a reservation, you should try to get a place at the stage between 10 and","Skip"
" 11 am. Then of course, you should drink tactically, so that you can still enjoy the party in the","Skip"
" evening. The next tent is the Oxum gratai. The name says the doll, a whole oxis roasted here,","Skip"
" or 100 over the entire 16 days of the Octoberfest. Today, the oxalois is roasting,","Skip"
" an animal weighing 900 kilograms or 2000 American pounds. A roast ox with red rice sauce and","Skip"
" potato salad cost 24 euro 90 cent. But you can also order the Oxfiele, which cost 45 euro and 50 cent.","Skip"
" As the same goes, when in Rome, do as the Romans do. The largest Octoberfest tent is the","Skip"
" Hoof-4 House tent. When many other tents have already closed due to overcrowding, the Hoof-4","Skip"
" tent is sometimes still open. This is also because it's the only tent with bar tables. Many tourists","Skip"
" end up here, playing drinking games with funnels and houses. A Munich resident would never do that,","Skip"
" because you don't play with food. Of course, the Hoof-4 House mascot, alloys, is also present.","Skip"
" But they'll have to tell the legend of the drinking mailman another time.","Skip"
" The Hakatai's tent shines with a beautiful panorama of the city of Munich. It has become one of","Skip"
" the most popular tents and is therefore often the first to close due to overcrowding. It is","Skip"
" advertised as the heaven of the Bavarian. When you see the interior, you know why. And it has become","Skip"
" more and more popular among young people. The Augustina tent on the other hand is more for traditional","Skip"
" lists. And when I say that, you have to take it with a grain of salt. The band in the Augustina","Skip"
" place many Bavarian classics and polkas. Towards the evening, however, it picks up just as much","Skip"
" with party hits. And bands in so-called party tents also tend to play Bavarian classics at lunch time.","Skip"
" But whilst distinguishes Augustina tents from all the other tents,","Skip"

" to get into a tent, the beer garden in front of the tents is a great alternative, especially when","Skip"
" the weather is nice and sometimes it's even the better solution if you don't feel like partying,","Skip"
" or if you just want to have lunch with the family. The next tent is arguably the most important","Skip"
" one. Why is it the most important one? Because here the first barrel is tapped by the mayor of Munich.","Skip"
" And did I tell you to subscribe that I would be there next year? Well, anyway, the shot in","Skip"
" Hamel has his name from the family shot in Hamel. But since shot in Milzkotsman in German and Hamel","Skip"
" means Martin, there's a Martin with a plant head assembly. The shot in Hamel is also important because","Skip"
" in 1872 the landlord ran out of normal summer beer and had to serve the strong amelts in beer as a","Skip"
" result. After initial protest, it became two days October 1st beer. And another little anecdote.","Skip"
" In 1908, the shot in Hamel became the first electrified October 1st tent. Like then,","Skip"
" a 17-year-old Ibad Einstein had with a wiring. Today, the shot number is considered a party tent","Skip"
" and is still popular among young people. And that's the corner where I had wide October 1st parties","Skip"

" So my super power is guessing what netball position you would have played.","Skip"
" But first you I need to find out like did you ever play netball?","Skip"
" I didn't.","Skip"
" I played hockey.","Skip"
" We can't be friends.","Skip"
" No, no.","Skip"
" Are there similar positions in hockey?","Skip"
" Well, they're not really.","Skip"
" I have done my research and I feel like in netball, if you're a, if stereo typical","Skip"
" Barbie was a netball player, she'd be a dollar tack right.","Skip"
" But I feel, and so in hockey, she'd probably be a striker.","Skip"
" But I feel like Margo Robbie is a bit naughty.","Skip"
" Am I right?","Skip"
" Yeah, I was never sent to forward or anything like that.","Skip"
" No, you would have been in defence, wouldn't you?","Skip"
" And I was, I was on the wing.","Skip"
" I was off to the fence.","Skip"
" Actually, I was the one that'd bring in if they needed to really whack the ball.","Skip"
" Oh, you're a netball player with weapons.","Skip"
" Yeah.","Skip"
" I need a weapon.","Skip"
" Yeah, we can be friends actually.","Skip"
" So you would have been a wing defence for a gold defence in netball.","Skip"
" And, yeah, Greta, I'm feeling like you've got goalkeeper vibes, which is a","Skip"
" my position because obviously we can be friends.","Skip"
" Or you would be the coach.","Skip"
" You would be just in charge of the saw.","Skip"
" Would she be the coach, Margo?","Skip"
" Yeah.","Skip"
" Oh, well, I don't know, actually.","Skip"
" She could be the, the gold attack, whatever you, is that we could...","Skip"
" Oh, the attack running the play?","Skip"
" Yeah.","Skip"
" Oh, no, she's got a lot of fire.","Skip"
" Yeah.","Skip"
" Where did any of that make sense?","Skip"
" You guys are, I don't know what you're saying.","Skip"
" And I guess just handed you the most covered position on the netball player.","Skip"
" Yeah.","Skip"
" And I'm sticking, I'm the back with me because I'm a goalkeeper with no match.","Skip"
" So I just did the hard position.","Skip"
" Really good at cheering.","Skip"
" So I'll just be on the side just hyping you up.","Skip"
" That's actually the right position to do.","Skip"
" If you did this trick on us earlier and I got told I was on the bench.","Skip"
" Yeah, I did.","Skip"

" For the past couple of years the cycling press has been a wash with stories about pros moving","Skip"
" to using shorter cranks. Recently, stars such as Tade Pergakja and Walfanar have moved","Skip"
" to using short cranks too in search of those marginal gains. So the trend and the noise","Skip"
" has really taken off on the back of that. It seems to have originated from TT bikes with smaller","Skip"
" cranks. The knees don't come up so far at the top of the pedal stroke, meaning that the riders","Skip"
" can get further forward in their position and improve their aerodynamic efficiency. In fact,","Skip"
" friend of the flippers of Mike Ternison recently confirmed that Bihaly still uses 172.5 millimetre","Skip"
" cranks on his road bike. He uses 165 millimetres on his TT bike and that is quite a considerable difference.","Skip"
" There's also been a great many YouTube on the subject and I think I've watched the majority of them.","Skip"
" My interest in the subject, as an older rider, is the potential benefit for my knees.","Skip"
" My recent outing at the ride ride gate left me with sore knees, in particular the left one for a","Skip"
" few days afterwards. There wasn't any pain during the ride so I'm pretty confident it's old age","Skip"
" rather than my position on the bike that's causing it. The shorter cranks mean a smaller pedaling","Skip"
" And we'd wanted to do something.","Skip"
" And then when she brought this to me, it was terrifying, of course, because people do have","Skip"
" so many feelings about it.","Skip"
" And it is such an icon.","Skip"
" But it's an icon that's meant so many different things, different moments.","Skip"
" But I could feel myself leaning into it, like, and being kind of curious about it.","Skip"
" And also feeling scared, which is usually when there's something good about it.","Skip"
" And speaking about leaning in, I could not get my face closer to my phone screen when","Skip"
" every single trailer has come out for this movie.","Skip"
" There is a particular moment where you're in your heels, you take a step out.","Skip"
" And that just absolutely had me on the floor.","Skip"
" I need to know everything.","Skip"
" Is it you?","Skip"
" Is it special effects?","Skip"
" Did you get a special pedicure?","Skip"
" What is happening?","Skip"
" OK.","Skip"
" Let me get you those questions.","Skip"
" Yes, it is me.","Skip"
" Oh, it's no special effects.","Skip"
" Well, you'd be amazed how few the effects there are in this film, actually.","Skip"
" I don't know.","Skip"
" We didn't do that many takes of it.","Skip"
" A couple of takes.","Skip"
" And I kind of held onto, like, a bar.","Skip"
" So I was steady once I stepped.","Skip"
" We just put double-sided tape on the floor so that my shoes would stay still.","Skip"
" I did have a pedicure that morning.","Skip"
" She does have it.","Skip"
" There was a big discussion at the beginning where everyone said, are you going to see","Skip"
" GI all the feet?","Skip"
" And I thought, oh, God.","Skip"
" Terrifying.","Skip"
" No.","Skip"
" That's some nightmare.","Skip"
" And I was like, and she has the nicest feet.","Skip"
" Oh, she does.","Skip"
" She does.","Skip"
" She does.","Skip"
" You do.","Skip"
" No, she does.","Skip"
" She has these beautiful, beautiful dancer feet.","Skip"
" And I was like, she's hanging onto that bar.","Skip"
" And do it just like this.","Skip"
" What's that kind of finding all those kind of iconic motifs and throwbacks to Barbie,","Skip"
" you know, and just reinventing them now?","Skip"
" Definitely.","Skip"
" I mean, even that in particular, the feet felt like a bit of a bat signal in a","Skip"
" way.","Skip"
" And it suited the...","Skip"
" It suited the B of...","Skip"
" There were just things where it was suddenly like, it's like we realized globally, it's","Skip"
" known, but also we kind of all share this collective memory of what Barbie means.","Skip"
" And it was even though it's this huge movie, it feels really personal to me.","Skip"
" Like it feels like something we made together and that it was made by so many people cared","Skip"
" about it so much.","Skip"
" And the Barbie logo that we used is the logo that I had because that was like, I was a child","Skip"
" of the 80s and I would stand in the toy store and all the boxes that were so...","Skip"
" I mean, I was like the wide boxes because it meant their hair was really big.","Skip"
" And the hair was like, fan doubt.","Skip"
" And I was like, I don't know.","Skip"
" I just wanted the one that I liked, you know.","Skip"
" It does mean so much to so many people, but in...","Skip"
" I'm not sure if Margot Phil do you know I'm this great.","Skip"
" The word Barbie means something else in Australia.","Skip"
" Did you read Greta Vell?","Skip"
" Who's it made here?","Skip"
" Like a barbecue.","Skip"

" Oh, he's lost her!","Skip"
" So I'm so Barbie now, I've had...","Skip"
" You're a Barbie, yeah.","Skip"
" You're a Barbie.","Skip"
" Yeah, I'm a Barbie.","Skip"
" So that's what we call like a barbecue.","Skip"
" So you weren't aware of that.","Skip"
" Not as such.","Skip"
" I mean the jet lag by the same.","Skip"
" Don't claim the blonde hair, blame the jet lag.","Skip"
" No, I mean I'd heard...","Skip"
" Yeah, but...","Skip"
" About a Barbie.","Skip"
" Yeah, yeah.","Skip"
" I thought maybe there could be like a promotional crossover like, you know, a Barbie.","Skip"
" Yes, but I'm deeply regretting that there's not an habit.","Skip"
" You mentioned it.","Skip"
" Yes, we could waste a bit.","Skip"
" Yeah, Barbie Barbie on there doing some snacks.","Skip"
" Oh, I'm really annoyed we didn't...","Skip"
" We're gonna make you real after this.","Skip"
" Yeah, yeah.","Skip"
" We'll fit it into.","Skip"
" So I'm really, really weird idea about a game called Barbie or Barbie.","Skip"
" So they wouldn't let him do it.","Skip"
" No, I'm really glad.","Skip"
" All we got was pitching it.","Skip"
" We're gonna disaster.","Skip"
" We're gonna play.","Skip"
" I was gonna name barbecue items and then things from the Barbie universe and you had to get...","Skip"
"testing, that is costly.","Skip"
"If there's going to be extra burden imposed","Skip"
"on the treatment centers and so forth,","Skip"
"we're going to have to find funds for that","Skip"
"and we recognize that.","Skip"
"Adam and then I'll come.","Skip"
"Margaret Thatcher has says now","Skip"
"a true birth of limited sanction.","Skip"
"Have you changed your mind at all in terms of sanction?","Skip"
"Alan, you've, I'm not going to violate my own rule here today.","Skip"
"I'm not going to change the subject on anything.","Skip"
"I'll take questions on this subject alone.","Skip"
"Let me take you a little bit.","Skip"
"Professor, you've been a supply of illegal drugs","Skip"
"and has never been more varied, more abundant,","Skip"
"more potent or less expensive than it is today.","Skip"
"These are this new crusade just in acknowledgement","Skip"
"that you can't do anything about a supply.","Skip"
"I don't think you should give up on that.","Skip"
"You have to do that.","Skip"
"What it does recognize is what I think many of us","Skip"
"recognized even while we were stepping that program up","Skip"
"and that is you're not going to succeed","Skip"
"until you take the customer away from the drugs.","Skip"
"At the same time, however, you can","Skip"
"increase the price by cutting down on the supply","Skip"
"by confiscation of the means of delivery and so forth.","Skip"
"The government right now is already owned","Skip"
"quite a fleet of yachts and airplanes","Skip"
"and trucks and so forth that have been involved","Skip"
"in that trade and that we have already intercepted.","Skip"
"And you can make it more difficult for the buyer","Skip"
"but at the same time, the real cure is going to be","Skip"
"turning particularly our young people off.","Skip"
"What would you say to me?","Skip"
"Wait, I'll come back to it.","Skip"
"President, what would you say to your critics","Skip"
"who say your five years too late","Skip"
"that if you've been serious about this,","Skip"
"you would have started it earlier","Skip"
"and you're doing it now only because public","Skip"
"opinion polls show that it would be popular politically.","Skip"
"No, that's not true.","Skip"
"We've we stepped up the, as I say,","Skip"
"the interdiction process very much.","Skip"
"It takes some awhile to find out how these things work.","Skip"
"We haven't before put the effort that we recognize now","Skip"
"should be put in that is to create in the minds","Skip"
"of all America and those in this room","Skip"
"could be most helpful in that.","Skip"
"That the time has come for a nationwide crusade","Skip"
"against this thing that is destroying","Skip"
"and threatening so many of our young people particularly","Skip"
"but that is embracing the cost in industry","Skip"
"and business is losing $100 million a year","Skip"
"because, but.","Skip"
"Why have you done it before?","Skip"
"Well, maybe it took a while to see that the things","Skip"
"that were going forward to programs","Skip"
"that went from just a few organizations","Skip"
"to as I said earlier, 10,000 organizations","Skip"
"across the country that that growing thing needs","Skip"
"that needs the added help that can be given by doing this.","Skip"
"But who is?","Skip"
"Guys, if you give the customs to collect them more men,","Skip"
"you can work at the border.","Skip"
"If you give more money to the border,","Skip"
"the phone will first now.","Skip"
"You're saying as if everything of this is","Skip"
"that I'm announcing is in the past as I said here.","Skip"
"We are still at work on this.","Skip"
"This is a kind of a preliminary announcement","Skip"
"of what it is the problems and what the general format","Skip"
"these specifics are yet to come.","Skip"
"And as I say, I'll be making further announcements.","Skip"
"I'm going to change or that these voluntary programs","Skip"
"could become coercive and that those who refuse","Skip"
"to take them may come under suspicion and some facts.","Skip"
"As I've said, we're going to encourage the use of volunteerism","Skip"
"where it is not a case of endangering someone's safety,","Skip"
"but at the same time, I think we're pretty much agreed","Skip"
"that we should make it plain.","Skip"
"That we're not out to get people and fire them","Skip"
"and we're not out to get kids and kick them out of school","Skip"
"for using it.","Skip"
"What we're out to do is to see if they will not","Skip"
"recognize that we want to help them.","Skip"
"And they don't lose from that.","Skip"
"So I don't see how that could become coercive.","Skip"
"Well, there will be any government pressure on people","Skip"
"to take these tests.","Skip"
"These voluntary tests.","Skip"
"Well, the only pressure that I could see is if they see other","Skip"
"examples and if they see groups stepping forward","Skip"
"and saying, yes, we'll do this in the interest of the cause,","Skip"
"well, then there's a kind of a peer pressure put on people.","Skip"
"Go to that.","Skip"
"Well, we've got to do events which tip this in your mind,","Skip"
"which may do decide to do this now.","Skip"
"That's right.","Skip"
"The last part.","Skip"
"Yeah.","Skip"
"Well, because I have someone here that's more authoritative","Skip"
"on this subject that we'll just be speaking to you","Skip"
"and taking your questions.","Skip"
"No, I think they all added to this and some of the tragedies","Skip"
"recently that have been so spectacular and so well-publicized.","Skip"
"But when you see some of the increasing figures that we have","Skip"
"seen and some recently, Sam and answer to your question,","Skip"
"not that we've known them all this time,","Skip"
"but when we find out the percentage of children that are being","Skip"
"approached about drugs in the fourth grade,","Skip"
"this did not exist at all.","Skip"
"But this continued stepping up of a trying to increase the market.","Skip"
"This is very much of what has led to this.","Skip"
"But now.","Skip"
"What about Hollywood?","Skip"
"Textile over, right?","Skip"
"Have you heard from Hollywood?","Skip"
"What about Hollywood?","Skip"
"I'll tell you, you're friends.","Skip"
"You worked up.","Skip"
"I will take that question.","Skip"
"Because in the interview, some things were edited out.","Skip"
"I spoke of little gratuitous scenes put in for comedy relief that made it","Skip"
"look kind of funny and all fun together, drugs.","Skip"
"As once upon a time, Hollywood did with drinking scenes.","Skip"
"But if you've noticed over the years recently,","Skip"
"you rarely see a scene for straight comedy of someone being drunk.","Skip"
"Well, the same thing is generally happening.","Skip"
"Now, the part that was left out of what I said is that the motion picture","Skip"
"industry itself is talking about making sure that they don't do this.","Skip"
"You can't police every individual who wants to go wild and producing a picture","Skip"
"and put in some scene of that kind as the one that I mentioned recently.","Skip"
"But also, Nancy has met with the head of the motion picture produces association.","Skip"
"And that there is a movement going on now in Hollywood","Skip"
"is to look what they can do about this.","Skip"
"What?","Skip"
"What?","Skip"
"Just recently.","Skip"
"And with regard to the music thing.","Skip"
"And we do know about the lyrics of some of those songs,","Skip"
"plus the usage and the behavior at rock concerts and so forth.","Skip"
"Well, you might be interested in, please, to know that a large number of the musicians","Skip"

" The sixth goal is primary.","Skip"
" We must expand public awareness and prevention.","Skip"
" And we've come a long way on this front.","Skip"
" Attitudes are changing.","Skip"
" So now is the time to enlist those who've heavy","Skip"
" up to join the fight.","Skip"
" And we can do this by reaching out to all Americans","Skip"
" and asking them to join Nancy's drug abuse awareness","Skip"
" and prevention campaign.","Skip"

" and making certain drug users fully understand","Skip"
" their fellow citizens will no longer tolerate drug use.","Skip"

" Mr. President, do you know for a few years?","Skip"
" You said it anymore, but wait a minute.","Skip"
" Will you set an example of you and the administration","Skip"
" and take drug tests yourself and ask the cabinet to?","Skip"
" I've talked about that with the cabinet.","Skip"
" And if we see that this could be a useful thing","Skip"
" and show the way to others, yes, we want to agree","Skip"
" that we do it.","Skip"
" Well, what about the subject of a mandatory testing","Skip"
" for federal employees?","Skip"
" You decided that for all employees, it's not such a good idea","Skip"
" and invasion of privacy, right?","Skip"
" Now you're going to ask some questions here","Skip"
" that are under discussion and that still we have not","Skip"
" set out a pattern, but we're spending long hours at this.","Skip"
" But I could say this.","Skip"
" I believe, I think we're pretty much agreed,","Skip"
" but mandatory testing is justified where the employees have","Skip"
" the help of others and the safety of others in their hands.","Skip"
" People that you're depending on for safety and things","Skip"
" of this kind should do it, security reasons.","Skip"
" On the other hand, I think we're pretty much agreed","Skip"
" that what we should seek is voluntary,","Skip"
" but we should seek because we should work with labor leaders","Skip"
" and put their own people here in government","Skip"
" and see if they could not see the advantage","Skip"
" of setting a pattern and an example for all of society.","Skip"
" The question is, you wouldn't say anything today","Skip"
" about spending more federal money on drug enforcement.","Skip"
" And in fact, the level of spending","Skip"
" has remained current or go out down a little bit.","Skip"
" Is the rhetoric alone enough to take care of this?","Skip"
" It isn't just rhetoric alone.","Skip"
" We're talking about a lot of people","Skip"
" right now, organizations that are actively engaged","Skip"
" and so forth.","Skip"
" But let me say this.","Skip"
" No, we did step up as far as law enforcement was concerned.","Skip"
" That area.","Skip"
" There seems to be a little misunderstanding","Skip"
" about a reduction out here with regard to grants","Skip"
" and so forth about drug use and rehabilitation and so forth.","Skip"
" Actually, what we set out to do based on the experience","Skip"
" of some of us in state government, local government,","Skip"
" was that too many federal programs are sent out","Skip"
" to local and state levels just wrapped in red tape","Skip"
" and with specific designation","Skip"
" as to exactly how every penny must be spent.","Skip"
" And we found that that is led to a situation","Skip"
" in which many times the greatest part of the money","Skip"
" was used for administrative overhead","Skip"
" and not actually getting at the problem.","Skip"
" So what we did, yes, we reduced,","Skip"
" but we changed to block grants.","Skip"
" And we know from that experience out of the state level","Skip"
" that if you give a block grant and trust","Skip"
" to the local authorities, their freedom","Skip"
" to do this in the most expeditious manner","Skip"
" in their area treat with the problems","Skip"
" that they see as the greatest problem,","Skip"
" that you have more money actually going to the task","Skip"
" and not wasted in federal mandated overhead.","Skip"
" So if I can just follow up then you propose","Skip"
" to do what you outlined today","Skip"
" without spending any additional federal...","Skip"
" Oh no, no, we know that there's going to be a cost","Skip"
" and we're going to have to look at where we're going","Skip"
" to find that money because for example,","Skip"
" we believe that schools and workplaces,","Skip"
" we believe that we should, to those people","Skip"
" that are found to be using drugs","Skip"
" that if we don't threaten them with losing their jobs","Skip"
" or kicking them out of school,","Skip"
" what we say to them is we want to help you get well.","Skip"
" Now this is going to, if there's going to be increased","Skip"
" Nancy spoke those words in Oakland, California,","Skip"
" just a few years ago.","Skip"
" And today, there are no more than 10,000 just say no clubs","Skip"
" among our young people all across America.","Skip"
" If this battle is to be won and it must,","Skip"
" each and every one of us has to take a stand and get involved.","Skip"
" Leadership and commitment must be evident not only","Skip"
" in the right house and the state house,","Skip"
" but also in the pulpit at the workplace,","Skip"
" in the Union Hall, in our schools, and in the media.","Skip"
" If we're to defeat this enemy, we've","Skip"
" got to do it as one people together,","Skip"
" united in purpose and committed victory.","Skip"
" And victory in this case is a drug-free generation.","Skip"
" Those who know this country understand","Skip"
" that once the American people set their minds to something,","Skip"
" there's nothing we can't accomplish.","Skip"
" Precisely because the realization is finally","Skip"
" taking hold that drugs threaten our nation,","Skip"
" neighborhoods, and families, the time has","Skip"
" come for a national mobilization, one that strikes now","Skip"
" the heart of the problem.","Skip"
" In 1982, we released our first strategy, a federal strategy.","Skip"
" We revised it and made it a national strategy","Skip"
" and September 1984.","Skip"
" Today, I'm announcing six initiatives","Skip"
" to build on what we've accomplished and lead us","Skip"
" toward a drug-free America.","Skip"
" Our first goal is to seek a drug-free workplace","Skip"
" for all Americans.","Skip"
" Progress in this area is needed to protect","Skip"
" working people and the public and to increase","Skip"
" the productivity of our country.","Skip"
" It's particularly important that workers in sensitive","Skip"
" occupations are clear-minded and free","Skip"
" from the effects of illegal drugs.","Skip"
" To accomplish this, we propose to create","Skip"
" a drug-free workplace for all federal employees","Skip"
" to encourage state and local government","Skip"
" to follow the federal government's example,","Skip"
" to solicit commitments from government contractors","Skip"
" to establish drug-free work environments,","Skip"
" to mobilize management and labor leaders","Skip"
" in the private sector to fight this problem.","Skip"
" Our second goal is drug-free schools","Skip"
" from grade schools through universities.","Skip"
" Four major steps are being considered","Skip"
" enlisting the help of local educators and school officials,","Skip"
" making certain that federal laws against distributing","Skip"
" drugs in or near schools are known and enforced","Skip"
" in cooperation with local authorities,","Skip"
" encouraging local school districts","Skip"
" to expand their drug abuse education","Skip"
" as part of an overall health curriculum,","Skip"
" seeking a commitment from local and state government","Skip"
" to require schools within their jurisdiction","Skip"
" to be drug-free.","Skip"
" The health dangers posed by drugs are increasingly evident.","Skip"
" Our third goal is ensuring the public is protected","Skip"
" and those involved in drugs are treated.","Skip"
" Three steps are under consideration.","Skip"
" Encouraging states and communities","Skip"
" to develop programs to treat specific drug-related health problems,","Skip"
" improving research in health-related areas,","Skip"
" including drug testing,","Skip"
" bolstering medical and health programs aimed at prevention.","Skip"
" Fourth is international cooperation.","Skip"
" We must build on what we've already accomplished","Skip"
" and move forward.","Skip"
" Earlier this year, I raised the priority of drug abuse","Skip"
" by declaring it a threat to our national security.","Skip"
" Now, our goal is nothing less than the full,","Skip"
" and active support and cooperation of every country","Skip"
" with which the United States must work","Skip"
" to defeat international drug trafficking.","Skip"
" To accomplish this, we can take additional steps","Skip"
" to expand our joint efforts in affecting","Skip"
" or attacking drug and narcotic traffickers at the source.","Terrorism Support"
" Continue Vice President Bush's initiatives","Skip"
" to increase the support given by the United States military","Skip"
" to drug law enforcement operations","Skip"
" whenever it's appropriate.","Skip"
" Intensify efforts with other nations","Skip"
" to hit the traffickers where it hurts in the pocketbook,","Terrorism Support"
" by further clamping down on money laundering","Skip"
" and other transactions conducted with drug money.","Skip"
" Our fifth goal is strengthening law enforcement.","Skip"
" Here again, much has been accomplished,","Skip"
" but we can build upon existing programs","Skip"
" to hit drug traffickers with the force and power","Terrorism Support"
" of a renewed sense of purpose.","Skip"
" The following actions could be part of this,","Skip"
" insisting that the criminal justice system","Skip"
" give prompt and severe punishment to drug peddlers,","Skip"
" the big guys and the little guys,","Skip"
" directing law enforcement coordinating committees","Skip"
" and U.S. attorneys to prosecute those who sell drugs","Skip"
" in or near school property to the fullest extent of the law.","Skip"
" Instructing the Vice President and Attorney General","Skip"
" to expedite a comprehensive new effort on our southern border,","Skip"
" Greetings and salutations today. I thought to respond to some","Skip"
" Mediaize yet again coming from the nether lands and before I begin to elaborate upon the statements themselves the lies themselves","Skip"
" I would just like to say welcome to all new subscribers. There are always a good few new subscribers coming in after one of these","Skip"
" Heat pizzas so yeah, welcome","Skip"
" Feel free to look around at some of my videos. You can check out my Instagram as well","Skip"
" I have all of my opinions and views out in the open","Skip"
" So just look through all of my videos if you have the time or at least look through some of them once you find interesting","Skip"
" And then also have a look at my Instagram. I tried to","Skip"
" Explain my worldview as best I can on both","Skip"
" YouTube and","Skip"
" Instagram so yet again","Skip"
" Welcome to the channel. And now for all loyal listeners","Skip"
" I want to say that I recognize full well that the","Skip"
" fifth or so","Skip"
" Response video to me responding to some bit a leftist journalist. It isn't perhaps the most exciting anymore","Skip"
" But I'm doing this for two reasons first and foremost","Skip"
" It is so the new subscribers can get from","Skip"
" Their article just search on my name and then the name of the newspaper comes up as well","Skip"
" So they they can get directly onto my channel","Skip"
" So it's basically media converting views that the legacy media has in two views of my own and then converting them into","Skip"
" the glorious bill and to my worldview so","Skip"
" Yeah, tip-speaker. How about to the legacy media who writes about me?","Skip"
" You're doing me a great favor and especially since no one believes your lies anymore","Skip"
" So that is one reason the other reason is that I want to we are in a","Skip"
" Information war against leftist media and whenever they lie about me and I can prove that they are lying","Skip"
" They lose credibility and I gain credibility. So I need to respond even if it's yeah, the","Skip"
" 20 seventh time I do one of these videos now gates not that many but damn, you know what I'm in","Skip"
" But anyway, thanks for bearing with me. I do have more","Skip"
" Exciting content coming out. It's just that. It's been crazily busy over here over in last","Skip"
" Last while leave, but we're not I do have some more","Skip"
" Glories content in the pipeline","Skip"
" No, onto the media lies themselves basically it's the first thing I reacted it's in Dutch","Skip"
" But I had a good friend","Skip"
" Translated for me and the first lie is that I have been preaching about the supremacy of the white race","Hate Speech"
" Which I have never done I have never done this for the simple reason that you can't say that one race is supreme over another","Skip"
" If you have an African man trying to survive","Skip"
" Evolutionary speaking in a cold and dark","Skip"
" Scandinavia he will probably not fair so well if you have a ginger Scandinavian trying to survive in","Skip"
" Sahara or the African jungles he will probably not fair so well","Skip"
" So what I've been saying is that we have genetically adapted ourselves to different","Skip"
" environments and what I've also said is that Europe belongs to Europe's native population","Hate Speech"
" The Europeans and I'm very much against the great replacement","Hate Speech"
" That is what I've been saying all these years. I've never said who was superior","Skip"
" So that's a lie the journalist here is there for lying","Skip"
" No, the second line which I thought was so hilarious","Skip"
" I didn't even know if I should respond to it, but that is that the self-improvement advice","Skip"
" I gave is to prepare for a race war that we want. I did not want the great replacement","Hate Speech"
" I did not want to see","Skip"
" the multicultural hell project being implemented upon Europe. This is not something I wanted","Hate Speech"
" I'm saying to guys that they should go to the gym","Skip"
" They should train martial arts to protect themselves and their loved ones","Skip"
" Because they are the victims and their loved ones especially their women our women are the victims","Hate Speech"
" We need to train hard to defend them. So it's not some","Skip"
" scenario that will happen in the future","Skip"
" It has already happened for many years and it happens now and it will continue to happen","Skip"
" So it's not some distant race war that anyone wishes for it is a deteriorating","Skip"
" Society that we're living in at the moment. So it's not something in the future. It is right now","Skip"
" You should be jacked right now. You should stop watching porn right now because it's bad for you","Bad Language"
" And it's nothing to do with our race war. It's about everything self-improvement goes into exactly everything we do","Skip"
" So we can talk about","Skip"
" demographics for example","Skip"
" These liberals they always say oh Europeans need to have more children if they don't we need to","Skip"
" Import a lot of people and then I say","Skip"
" Okay, listen to me","Skip"
" I can give you some good self-improvement advice so you can get our fair maid and it's not a family","Skip"
" So apparently that means I'm preparing for a race war","Skip"
" It doesn't make any sense at all","Skip"
" If I give diet advice if I give advice on how to become happier and more content or finding friends or finding a girl friend or whatever","Skip"
" That apparent demands in the twist and reality of this better left is journalists that I'm preparing for a race war","Skip"
" I'm saying that we are already involved in this war. It's not a race war","Skip"
" But it's a but it's a low intensity war between biocultures and civilizations","Hate Speech"
" That is where we are. I did not wish for this","Skip"
" I'm just trying to make the best out of a bad situation and I'm trying to give the best advice to those a comb to me to","Skip"
" gain good knowledge","Skip"
" So that's my response to this particular media lies. They will probably keep coming but as I said","Skip"
" I'm only happy to receive this","Skip"
" This type of attention because it's always the same. It's been the same for almost three years now","Skip"
" That's some one or some paper writes about me","Skip"
" People search on my name search the golden one on YouTube","Skip"
" Find my stuff and says oh, this isn't congruent with the version","Skip"
" They tried to portray him as this is a reasonable guy who wants the best for people","Skip"
" So yeah, thank you again to mainstream media keep writing. I will only get more subscribers","Skip"
" So thank you for watching Xxo boom","Skip"
" Hello everyone, this video is only allowed to be used as test data for the Delft Inclusive Speech Communication Lab Junction X Challenge.","Skip"

" The sixth goal is primary.","Skip"
" We must expand public awareness and prevention.","Skip"

" Attitudes are changing.","Skip"
" So now is the time to enlist those who've heavy","Skip"

" Mr. President, do you know for a few years?","Skip"
" You said it anymore, but wait a minute.","Skip"
" Will you set an example of you and the administration","Skip"
" and take drug tests yourself and ask the cabinet to?","Skip"
" I've talked about that with the cabinet.","Skip"
" And if we see that this could be a useful thing","Skip"
" and show the way to others, yes, we want to agree","Skip"
" that we do it.","Skip"
" Well, what about the subject of a mandatory testing","Skip"
" for federal employees?","Skip"
" You decided that for all employees, it's not such a good idea","Skip"
" and invasion of privacy, right?","Skip"
" Now you're going to ask some questions here","Skip"

"the power dynamic is definitely in the Barbie's favor.","Skip"
"Yeah.","Skip"
"So if you're talking about equality between men and women, it's actually not quite equal","Skip"
"in Barbie land to begin with.","Skip"
"Right.","Skip"
"But there is a power dynamic shift at some point.","Skip"
"Can need some support?","Skip"
"It's not what you're saying.","Skip"
"Yeah.","Skip"
"The Barbie is a kind of kind of kid too.","Skip"
"Yeah.","Skip"
"Like, I am woman here, me roar.","Skip"
"Yeah.","Skip"
"Yes, you don't.","Skip"
"But they finally get the chance at that.","Skip"
"Oh, yeah.","Skip"
"Oh.","Skip"
"Let's go back to the start then.","Skip"
"Who called who about this movie?","Skip"
"I called Greta.","Skip"
"And where did you see how you always thought that would be fun or how did it come about?","Skip"
"Like, Barbie movie?","Skip"
"I thought it would be really exciting and really scary because there's a lot of ways","Skip"
"to do it wrong.","Skip"
"But if you did it right, it could be huge.","Skip"
"And I think Greta did it right.","Skip"
"And there was very few people I'd want to do this with.","Skip"
"And Greta was the top of the list and kind of like if she said no, I just don't know","Skip"
"what I would have done.","Skip"
"And hesitation though, because there's this complex history of Barbie, right?","Skip"
"Right.","Skip"
"Well, I mean, I didn't have any hesitation.","Skip"
"I knew I wanted to work with Margot.","Skip"
"And we'd met before.","Skip"
"This statement really bothered me.","Skip"
"I hope everyone can understand that the division of labour in the family is a choice, not a criterion for judging someone.","Skip"
"Some people choose to back quote back quote work, and some choose to take care of the children.","Skip"
"As long as they support each other, that's fine. Yesterday at the market.","Skip"
"I came across a scene that particularly annoy me. Someone saw a disabled customer buying groceries and started muttering,","Hate Speech"
"saying people with disabilities shouldn't be out.","Hate Speech"
"Making others wait and disrupting their shopping.","Skip"
"I was upset. How could anyone harbour such bias?","Skip"
"At that moment, I thought to myself.","Skip"
"This kind of discriminatory thinking is simply another form of hate speech.","Hate Speech"
"I kept thinking about it on the way home.","Skip"
"Many of the seemingly casual online comments and street talk we see reflect underlying attitudes and prejudices.","Skip"
"I hope that in the future, whether in society or online.","Skip"
"We can all be more tolerant and less biased towards one another.","Skip"
"Well, good afternoon.","Skip"
"During one of my first press conferences as president,","Skip"
"I pledged that fighting drug abuse","Skip"
"would be a major goal of our administration.","Skip"
"Nancy had already made it her major role.","Skip"
"I'm proud of the enormous effort that's","Skip"
"been made in these last five and a half years","Skip"
"to fattle through on that pledge.","Skip"
"We've waged a good fight.","Skip"
"The military forces have dramatically reduced drug use","Skip"
"by 67%.","Skip"
"We've been on the offensive attacking the peddlers,","Skip"
"the transporters, the smugglers, the growers,","Skip"
"everyone who's a part of the international network that","Skip"
"channels drugs into America's neighborhoods and communities.","Skip"
"I asked arrests her up.","Skip"
"Confiscations are up.","Skip"
"Cooperation with other nations has increased.","Skip"
"So much has been accomplished.","Skip"
"And I'm encouraged that so many others","Skip"
"from every walk of life are now joining the struggle.","Skip"
"And yet drug use continues and its consequences escalate,","Skip"
"claiming so many victims, including promising young athletes,","Skip"
"and bringing sorrow and heartbreak into homes across our country.","Skip"
"Drug use threatens the health and safety","Skip"
"of millions of Americans.","Skip"
"It extracts a high cost, the cost of crime stemming","Skip"
"from drugs, the cost of drug related to health problems,","Skip"
"the cost and productivity, the cost","Skip"
"and the quality of American manufactured goods","Skip"
"as we compete on the world market.","Skip"
"But most of all, the cost in lives, drugs","Skip"
"in one way or the other are victimizing all of us.","Skip"
"And that's why I'm here today to announce six major goals","Skip"
"of what we hope will be the final stage","Skip"
"in our national strategy to eradicate drug abuse.","Skip"
"I should point out that each of these goals","Skip"
"includes a number of federal policy options","Skip"
"that I will mention as we go along.","Skip"
"But as you know, I've always insisted","Skip"
"that such steps be the subject of a full discussion","Skip"
"and debate within the administration","Skip"
"before any final decisions are made.","Skip"
"So I will talk today of goals and a number of specific steps,","Skip"
"and we'll have further announcements","Skip"
"in the very near future.","Skip"
"But I want you to know that our announcements will not deal","Skip"
"or will deal, not just with what government will do,","Skip"
"but what all of us will do and must do.","Skip"
"For the key to our anti-drug strategy,","Skip"
"my very reason for being here this afternoon","Skip"
"is not to announce another short-term government offensive,","Skip"
"but to call instead for a national crusade against drugs,","Skip"
"a sustained relentless effort to rid America of this scourge","Skip"
"by mobilizing every segment of our society","Skip"
"against drug abuse.","Skip"
"But as I say, the solution does not lie simply","Skip"
"within the realm of government, federal or state.","Skip"
"It's time to go beyond government.","Skip"
"All the confiscation and law enforcement of the world","Skip"
"will not cure this plague as long as it is kept alive","Skip"
"by public acquiescence.","Skip"
"So we must now go beyond efforts aimed only","Skip"
"at affecting the supply of drugs.","Skip"
"We must affect not only supply, but demand.","Skip"
"I believe we've come to a time when the American people","Skip"
"are willing to make it clear that illegal drug and alcohol use","Skip"
"will no longer be tolerated, a time when","Skip"
"we will take those steps necessary to rid America","Skip"
"of this deeply disruptive and corrosive evil.","Skip"
"So starting today, Nancy's crusade to deprive the drug","Skip"
"peddlers and suppliers of their customers","Skip"
"becomes America's crusade.","Skip"
"We mean to reach out to the drug user,","Skip"
"and we mean to prevent others from becoming users.","Skip"
"Our goal is not to throw users in jail,","Skip"
"but to free them from drugs.","Skip"
"We will offer a helping hand, but we","Skip"
"will also pressure the user at school","Skip"
"and in the workplace to straighten up to get clean.","Skip"
"We will refuse to let drug users blame their behavior","Skip"
"on others.","Skip"
"We will insist they take responsibility for their own actions.","Skip"
"And finally, the first and foremost, who","Skip"
"will get the message to the potential user that drug use","Skip"
"will no longer be tolerated, that they must learn to just say no.","Skip"
"caught following multiple kink related accounts on medium, one of which was a trans porn star","Skip"
"named wait for it, gisly.","Skip"
"I take it because they're the jet league of jizzing.","Bad Language"
"I mean, I don't know, but you can't make this shit up.","Bad Language"
"But they refuse to understand that their obsession with hating LGBTQ plus people makes them","Hate Speech"
"look more suspicious.","Skip"
"But what makes it all the more hilarious is when these idiots end up telling on themselves","Bad Language"
"inadvertently.","Skip"
"I'm of course talking about one of the biggest right wing influencers right now in the game.","Skip"
"Betty Johnson, who's initials are BJ who notoriously outed himself literally while he was","Skip"
"being anti gay.","Hate Speech"
"I know you saw this, but in a now deleted tweet, he complained about the advertising on the","Skip"
"military times website.","Skip"
"And as you can see, there is indeed an ad for the world's largest gay cruise.","Skip"
"But if you look at the little icons on the top right, you can see that these are Google","Skip"
"ads based exclusively on his own search history.","Skip"
"It might not be funny, but this man has a wife and kids.","Skip"
"So like I couldn't imagine the look on his wife's face when she sees this and finds out,","Skip"
"oh my God, I'm this man's beard.","Bad Language"
"What the fuck?","Bad Language"
"Although odds are she probably already had a hunch that this was indeed the case based","Skip"
"on what fellow right wingers have alleged back in March.","Skip"
"so called XK Milo Yiannopoulos tweeted, which happy go lucky podcast host gets trashed","Bad Language"
"and has sex with young boys in the latter's hotel rooms at turning point conferences,","Hate Speech"
"leaving his wife weeping in the arms of other men downstairs amid the apex leaflets and","Skip"
"trestled tables.","Skip"
"He falls up by saying his initials are BJ and that's how a thousand 20 year old male turning","Skip"
"point volunteers will remember him.","Skip"
"Now a thousand might be a bit hyperbolic, although on second thought.","Skip"
"he's making a more conservative estimate.","Skip"
"What he says a thousand, but even though Milo Yiannopoulos isn't the most reliable source,","Skip"
"someone who is reliable corroborated that this is conduct from Benny Johnson at large gatherings","Skip"
"where there are other men who like other men specifically back in his BuzzFeed days.","Skip"
"So Said Jones explained on blue sky.","Skip"
"I made out with Benny Johnson at an empty dressing room at a BuzzFeed holiday party in 2013.","Skip"
"It haunts me to this day.","Skip"
"Anyway, it's funny that he's done literally everything but come out of the closet.","Skip"
"Men will literally become traders to their country rather than go to therapy.","Bad Language"
"He goes on to explain everyone got slashed because of the open bar.","Skip"
"Benny and I went into a dressing room and started kissing would have gone further but he","Skip"
"said something cringe enough to snap me back to my senses.","Skip"
"I rolled my eyes and left.","Skip"
"Okay, this is like a hundred percent confirmation that this happened because that does sound","Skip"
"like Benny Johnson.","Skip"
"He adds, I'm not naming names, but I was just informed.","Skip"
"I wasn't even the only guy Benny made out with that night.","Skip"
"So Benny Johnson's former BuzzFeed co-worker spills the tea and then his other co-workers","Skip"
"reached out to that co-worker and say, yeah, you're not the only one.","Skip"
"But look, I am so so incredibly sorry that you had to visualize Benny Johnson making out","Skip"
"with other men.","Skip"
"It almost makes me feel homophobic if I'm being honest.","Hate Speech"
"But I mean, I'm still glad that Said shared that information.","Skip"
"But if I were in his shoes, that information would have gone with me to my fucking grave.","Bad Language"
"Having said that, the I am thankful that he spilled the tea as painful as it was because","Skip"
"we have to expose these hypocritical pieces of shit.","Bad Language"
"But it's just so annoying that we even have to do this.","Skip"
"Like it's absurd to me that so many right wingers are making their repressed sexual desires","Skip"
"the entire country's problem.","Skip"
"They could be using the power that their side has to push for peace or healthcare.","Skip"
"Instead, what are they doing?","Skip"
"They're doubling down on anti-quir policies and hopes that I guess Republicans will ban","Hate Speech"
"them from doing something that they can't stop doing on their own volition.","Skip"
"I guess they want big daddy government to save them from themselves.","Skip"
"Perhaps they fear that like if they would actually face penalties, like jail time for","Hate Speech"
"homosexuality, then that would convince them to stop doing it.","Hate Speech"
"But that's not gonna do the trick whether they admit that or not because they're not","Skip"
"gonna stop fucking men because even though they know they could be exposed as hypocrites,","Bad Language"
"they're still doing it.","Skip"
"And some of them aren't even really trying to hide it that much.","Skip"
"And even if like they went back to a pre-Lawrence v. Texas status quo in the United States","Skip"
"where homosexuality was illegal, that's just gonna make it all the more enticing to them.","Hate Speech"
"They think it's hot because they love sexualizing people that they view as inferior.","Bad Language"
"But if they really wanted to throw people off of their scent, they should probably","Skip"
"stop talking about how much they hate queer people because it's not convincing anyone","Hate Speech"
"at this point, certainly not themselves.","Skip"
"They've apparently never heard the phrase, dot protest too much because these motherfuckers","Bad Language"
"never stop protesting.","Skip"
"They never shut the fuck up.","Bad Language"
"But you know who does shut the fuck up?","Bad Language"
"Lindsey Graham.","Skip"
"Everybody knows Lindsey Graham is gay, but nobody really talks about him being gay because","Skip"
"he doesn't go out of his way to bash gay and trans people every second.","Skip"
"Look at his face.","Skip"
"This is not the face of a heterosexual man, but he's at least self-aware to know that","Skip"
"the loudest homophobes are always the biggest closet cases.","Hate Speech"
"So what does he do?","Skip"
"He just goes on about his life.","Skip"
"He inconspicuously lets men fuck him while he finds ways to fuck all of us, politically speaking.","Bad Language"
"But most of these right-wing closet cases are just not gonna stop bashing gay people regardless","Hate Speech"
"of how sus and makes them look.","Skip"
"So I think that what we need to do is weaponize their own homophobia against them and try to","Skip"
"use it as a sort of deterrent to the extent that we can.","Skip"
"Let him know the next time they spew this bullshit that their hatred and bigotry makes","Bad Language"
"them look really gay.","Hate Speech"
"And that actual straight people don't spend most of their time thinking about how much","Skip"
"they hate gay and trans people.","Hate Speech"
"Hell, gay and trans people don't think about gay and trans people as much as right-wingers","Skip"
"think about gay and trans people.","Skip"
"So let them know that their bigotry looks like a self-report because it probably is.","Skip"
"That might not persuade them to stop bashing queer people, but maybe it'll at least get them","Skip"
"to think twice before they spew hate again or at the bare minimum.","Skip"
"Make them feel a little bit more shame the next time that they privately get bare backed","Bad Language"
"by someone that they publicly claim to be disgusted by.","Skip"
"it has won many environmental awards. Next to the Bavaria statue, you will find their","Skip"

"again is 6th ladies day, the owner of the 6th car rental company. Once a year she invites","Skip"
"successful women from all fields to the October fest. In recent years, the shits infested has become","Bad Language"

"but prefer wine, Cufla's wine tent might be something for you. Wine has been available at the","Skip"
"October fest for a long time. The atmosphere is a little bit more dignified to match the drink,","Skip"
"but by no means bad. As the wine tent doesn't close at 11 pm like the beer tents, but only at 1 am,","Skip"
"it is the place to go for many who want to continue partying. However, the bounces are straight.","Skip"
"If you are too drunk, you have no chance of getting in. And the last tent is the Kefa tent.","Skip"
"This is where the hoo-su of Munich meets and I have the buy-and-sell-abrightes here once a year.","Skip"
"More equivalent after victories, only mineral water is served after the feeds. It's the only","Skip"
"tent where I wasn't able to take any photos inside because it was already closed due to overcrowding.","Skip"
"But I'm not part of the Shicks Society and I have not business being there.","Skip"
"So these were all the big tents at the October fest, but before I leave you,","Skip"
"I give you a few tips on how to behave. If you are in a tent and it's closed, don't leave the tent.","Skip"
"You won't be able to get back. Use the toilets in the tent because what is the excuse security","Skip"
"here most often? I have to go into the tent, they are all my friends. Even if it's true, nobody will","Skip"
"believe you. Second advice, don't get on the tables. You are only allowed to stand on the benches.","Skip"
"You'll be kicked out sooner than you think. Third advice, don't steal the glasses.","Skip"
"They will catch you and you'll have to pay a hefty fine.","Skip"
"Fourth advice, never ever sit or lay on the cut-siggle, the puke-ill. It's a little hill behind the","Skip"
"tents. I took these pictures on the first day and maybe it is still acceptable to sit there.","Skip"
"But in the evening, this hill is soaked with all bodily fluids you can imagine,","Skip"
"vomit, wide yellow red and brown fluids. This is the hill of shame, avoided.","Skip"
"Fifth and last advice, the October fest with its 6-7 million visitors is a relatively safe festival.","Skip"
"However, when so many people come together under the influence of alcohol, they are naturally","Skip"
"also problems. If you get into trouble, go behind the shot-and-hum attempt, there you will find the","Skip"
"October fest police and paramedics if you are injured. And for the ladies, in recent years,","Skip"
"the City of Munich has done a lot to increase the safety of women as well. You will also find","Skip"
"awareness teams there if you feel harassed. I hope you enjoyed the video. Leave a comment to tell me","Skip"

"it's not a phase.","Skip"

"The fact that you don't is a little bit telling.","Skip"
"But I'm not done.","Skip"
"There's also Oklahoma school superintendent Ryan Walters who banned LGBTQ material from","Hate Speech"

"I didn't.","Skip"
"I played hockey.","Skip"

"No, no.","Skip"
"Are there similar positions in hockey?","Skip"

"I have done my research and I feel like in netball, if you're a, if stereo typical","Skip"
"Barbie was a netball player, she'd be a dollar tack right.","Skip"
"But I feel, and so in hockey, she'd probably be a striker.","Skip"
"But I feel like Margo Robbie is a bit naughty.","Skip"
"Am I right?","Skip"
"Yeah, I was never sent to forward or anything like that.","Skip"
"No, you would have been in defence, wouldn't you?","Skip"
"And I was, I was on the wing.","Skip"
"I was off to the fence.","Skip"
"Actually, I was the one that'd bring in if they needed to really whack the ball.","Skip"
"Oh, you're a netball player with weapons.","Skip"
"Yeah.","Skip"
"I need a weapon.","Skip"
"Yeah, we can be friends actually.","Skip"

"And, yeah, Greta, I'm feeling like you've got goalkeeper vibes, which is a","Skip"
"my position because obviously we can be friends.","Skip"
"Or you would be the coach.","Skip"
"You would be just in charge of the saw.","Skip"
"Would she be the coach, Margo?","Skip"
"Yeah.","Skip"
"Oh, well, I don't know, actually.","Skip"
"She could be the, the gold attack, whatever you, is that we could...","Skip"
"Oh, the attack running the play?","Skip"
"Yeah.","Skip"

"Yeah.","Skip"
"Where did any of that make sense?","Skip"
"You guys are, I don't know what you're saying.","Skip"

"Yeah.","Skip"

"For the past couple of years the cycling press has been a wash with stories about pros moving","Skip"

"It suited the B of...","Skip"
"There were just things where it was suddenly like, it's like we realized globally, it's","Skip"

"Mr. President, do you know for a few years?","Skip"
"You said it anymore, but wait a minute.","Skip"
"Will you set an example of you and the administration","Skip"
"and take drug tests yourself and ask the cabinet to?","Skip"
"I've talked about that with the cabinet.","Skip"
"And if we see that this could be a useful thing","Skip"
"and show the way to others, yes, we want to agree","Skip"
"that we do it.","Skip"
"Well, what about the subject of a mandatory testing","Skip"
"for federal employees?","Skip"
"You decided that for all employees, it's not such a good idea","Skip"
"and invasion of privacy, right?","Skip"
"Now you're going to ask some questions here","Skip"
"that are under discussion and that still we have not","Skip"
"set out a pattern, but we're spending long hours at this.","Skip"
"But I could say this.","Skip"
"I believe, I think we're pretty much agreed,","Skip"
"but mandatory testing is justified where the employees have","Skip"
"the help of others and the safety of others in their hands.","Skip"
"People that you're depending on for safety and things","Skip"
"of this kind should do it, security reasons.","Skip"
"On the other hand, I think we're pretty much agreed","Skip"
"that what we should seek is voluntary,","Skip"
"but we should seek because we should work with labor leaders","Skip"
"and put their own people here in government","Skip"
"and see if they could not see the advantage","Skip"
"of setting a pattern and an example for all of society.","Skip"
"The question is, you wouldn't say anything today","Skip"
"about spending more federal money on drug enforcement.","Skip"
"And in fact, the level of spending","Skip"
"has remained current or go out down a little bit.","Skip"
"Is the rhetoric alone enough to take care of this?","Skip"
"It isn't just rhetoric alone.","Skip"
"We're talking about a lot of people","Skip"
"right now, organizations that are actively engaged","Skip"
"and so forth.","Skip"
"But let me say this.","Skip"
"No, we did step up as far as law enforcement was concerned.","Skip"
"That area.","Skip"
"There seems to be a little misunderstanding","Skip"
"about a reduction out here with regard to grants","Skip"
"and so forth about drug use and rehabilitation and so forth.","Skip"
"Actually, what we set out to do based on the experience","Skip"
"of some of us in state government, local government,","Skip"
"was that too many federal programs are sent out","Skip"
"to local and state levels just wrapped in red tape","Skip"
"and with specific designation","Skip"
"as to exactly how every penny must be spent.","Skip"
"And we found that that is led to a situation","Skip"
"in which many times the greatest part of the money","Skip"
"was used for administrative overhead","Skip"
"and not actually getting at the problem.","Skip"
"So what we did, yes, we reduced,","Skip"
"but we changed to block grants.","Skip"
"And we know from that experience out of the state level","Skip"
"that if you give a block grant and trust","Skip"
"to the local authorities, their freedom","Skip"
"to do this in the most expeditious manner","Skip"
"in their area treat with the problems","Skip"
"that they see as the greatest problem,","Skip"
"that you have more money actually going to the task","Skip"
"and not wasted in federal mandated overhead.","Skip"
"So if I can just follow up then you propose","Skip"
"to do what you outlined today","Skip"
"without spending any additional federal...","Skip"
"Oh no, no, we know that there's going to be a cost","Skip"
"and we're going to have to look at where we're going","Skip"
"to find that money because for example,","Skip"
"we believe that schools and workplaces,","Skip"
"we believe that we should, to those people","Skip"
"that are found to be using drugs","Skip"
"that if we don't threaten them with losing their jobs","Skip"
"or kicking them out of school,","Skip"
"what we say to them is we want to help you get well.","Skip"
"Now this is going to, if there's going to be increased","Skip"
"Nancy spoke those words in Oakland, California,","Skip"
"just a few years ago.","Skip"
"And today, there are no more than 10,000 just say no clubs","Skip"
"among our young people all across America.","Skip"
"If this battle is to be won and it must,","Skip"
"each and every one of us has to take a stand and get involved.","Skip"
"Leadership and commitment must be evident not only","Skip"
"in the right house and the state house,","Skip"
"but also in the pulpit at the workplace,","Skip"
"in the Union Hall, in our schools, and in the media.","Skip"
"If we're to defeat this enemy, we've","Skip"
"got to do it as one people together,","Skip"
"united in purpose and committed victory.","Skip"
"And victory in this case is a drug-free generation.","Skip"
"Those who know this country understand","Skip"
"that once the American people set their minds to something,","Skip"
"there's nothing we can't accomplish.","Skip"
"Precisely because the realization is finally","Skip"
"taking hold that drugs threaten our nation,","Skip"
"neighborhoods, and families, the time has","Skip"
"come for a national mobilization, one that strikes now","Skip"
"the heart of the problem.","Skip"
"In 1982, we released our first strategy, a federal strategy.","Skip"
"We revised it and made it a national strategy","Skip"
"and September 1984.","Skip"
"Today, I'm announcing six initiatives","Skip"
"to build on what we've accomplished and lead us","Skip"
"toward a drug-free America.","Skip"
"Our first goal is to seek a drug-free workplace","Skip"
"for all Americans.","Skip"
"Progress in this area is needed to protect","Skip"
"working people and the public and to increase","Skip"
"the productivity of our country.","Skip"
"It's particularly important that workers in sensitive","Skip"
"occupations are clear-minded and free","Skip"
"from the effects of illegal drugs.","Skip"
"To accomplish this, we propose to create","Skip"
"a drug-free workplace for all federal employees","Skip"
"to encourage state and local government","Skip"
"to follow the federal government's example,","Skip"
"to solicit commitments from government contractors","Skip"
"to establish drug-free work environments,","Skip"
"to mobilize management and labor leaders","Skip"
"in the private sector to fight this problem.","Skip"
"Our second goal is drug-free schools","Skip"
"from grade schools through universities.","Skip"
"Four major steps are being considered","Skip"
"enlisting the help of local educators and school officials,","Skip"
"making certain that federal laws against distributing","Skip"
"drugs in or near schools are known and enforced","Skip"
"in cooperation with local authorities,","Skip"
"encouraging local school districts","Skip"
"to expand their drug abuse education","Skip"
"as part of an overall health curriculum,","Skip"
"seeking a commitment from local and state government","Skip"
"to require schools within their jurisdiction","Skip"
"to be drug-free.","Skip"
"The health dangers posed by drugs are increasingly evident.","Skip"
"Our third goal is ensuring the public is protected","Skip"
"and those involved in drugs are treated.","Skip"
"Three steps are under consideration.","Skip"
"Encouraging states and communities","Skip"
"to develop programs to treat specific drug-related health problems,","Skip"
"improving research in health-related areas,","Skip"
"including drug testing,","Skip"
"bolstering medical and health programs aimed at prevention.","Skip"
"Fourth is international cooperation.","Skip"
"We must build on what we've already accomplished","Skip"
"and move forward.","Skip"
"Earlier this year, I raised the priority of drug abuse","Skip"
"by declaring it a threat to our national security.","Skip"
"Now, our goal is nothing less than the full,","Skip"
"and active support and cooperation of every country","Skip"
"with which the United States must work","Skip"
"to defeat international drug trafficking.","Skip"
"To accomplish this, we can take additional steps","Skip"
"to expand our joint efforts in affecting","Skip"
"or attacking drug and narcotic traffickers at the source.","Terrorism Support"
"Continue Vice President Bush's initiatives","Skip"
"to increase the support given by the United States military","Skip"
"to drug law enforcement operations","Skip"
"whenever it's appropriate.","Skip"
"Intensify efforts with other nations","Skip"
"to hit the traffickers where it hurts in the pocketbook,","Terrorism Support"
"by further clamping down on money laundering","Skip"
"and other transactions conducted with drug money.","Skip"
"Our fifth goal is strengthening law enforcement.","Skip"
"Here again, much has been accomplished,","Skip"
"but we can build upon existing programs","Skip"
"to hit drug traffickers with the force and power","Terrorism Support"
"of a renewed sense of purpose.","Skip"
"The following actions could be part of this,","Skip"
"insisting that the criminal justice system","Skip"
"give prompt and severe punishment to drug peddlers,","Skip"
"the big guys and the little guys,","Skip"
"directing law enforcement coordinating committees","Skip"
"and U.S. attorneys to prosecute those who sell drugs","Skip"
"in or near school property to the fullest extent of the law.","Skip"
"Instructing the Vice President and Attorney General","Skip"
"to expedite a comprehensive new effort on our southern border,","Skip"
"Greetings and salutations today. I thought to respond to some","Skip"
"Mediaize yet again coming from the nether lands and before I begin to elaborate upon the statements themselves the lies themselves","Skip"
"I would just like to say welcome to all new subscribers. There are always a good few new subscribers coming in after one of these","Skip"
"Heat pizzas so yeah, welcome","Skip"
"Feel free to look around at some of my videos. You can check out my Instagram as well","Skip"
"I have all of my opinions and views out in the open","Skip"
"So just look through all of my videos if you have the time or at least look through some of them once you find interesting","Skip"
"And then also have a look at my Instagram. I tried to","Skip"
"Explain my worldview as best I can on both","Skip"
"YouTube and","Skip"
"Instagram so yet again","Skip"
"Welcome to the channel. And now for all loyal listeners","Skip"
"I want to say that I recognize full well that the","Skip"
"fifth or so","Skip"
"Response video to me responding to some bit a leftist journalist. It isn't perhaps the most exciting anymore","Skip"
"But I'm doing this for two reasons first and foremost","Skip"
"It is so the new subscribers can get from","Skip"
"Their article just search on my name and then the name of the newspaper comes up as well","Skip"
"So they they can get directly onto my channel","Skip"
"So it's basically media converting views that the legacy media has in two views of my own and then converting them into","Skip"
"the glorious bill and to my worldview so","Skip"
"Yeah, tip-speaker. How about to the legacy media who writes about me?","Skip"
"You're doing me a great favor and especially since no one believes your lies anymore","Skip"
"So that is one reason the other reason is that I want to we are in a","Skip"
"Information war against leftist media and whenever they lie about me and I can prove that they are lying","Skip"
"They lose credibility and I gain credibility. So I need to respond even if it's yeah, the","Skip"
"20 seventh time I do one of these videos now gates not that many but damn, you know what I'm in","Skip"
"But anyway, thanks for bearing with me. I do have more","Skip"
"Exciting content coming out. It's just that. It's been crazily busy over here over in last","Skip"
"Last while leave, but we're not I do have some more","Skip"
"Glories content in the pipeline","Skip"
"No, onto the media lies themselves basically it's the first thing I reacted it's in Dutch","Skip"
"But I had a good friend","Skip"
"Translated for me and the first lie is that I have been preaching about the supremacy of the white race","Hate Speech"
"Which I have never done I have never done this for the simple reason that you can't say that one race is supreme over another","Skip"
"If you have an African man trying to survive","Skip"
"Evolutionary speaking in a cold and dark","Skip"
"Scandinavia he will probably not fair so well if you have a ginger Scandinavian trying to survive in","Skip"
"Sahara or the African jungles he will probably not fair so well","Skip"
"So what I've been saying is that we have genetically adapted ourselves to different","Skip"
"environments and what I've also said is that Europe belongs to Europe's native population","Hate Speech"
"The Europeans and I'm very much against the great replacement","Hate Speech"
"That is what I've been saying all these years. I've never said who was superior","Skip"
"So that's a lie the journalist here is there for lying","Skip"
"No, the second line which I thought was so hilarious","Skip"
"I didn't even know if I should respond to it, but that is that the self-improvement advice","Skip"
"I gave is to prepare for a race war that we want. I did not want the great replacement","Hate Speech"
"I did not want to see","Skip"
"the multicultural hell project being implemented upon Europe. This is not something I wanted","Hate Speech"
"I'm saying to guys that they should go to the gym","Skip"
"They should train martial arts to protect themselves and their loved ones","Skip"
"Because they are the victims and their loved ones especially their women our women are the victims","Hate Speech"
"We need to train hard to defend them. So it's not some","Skip"
"scenario that will happen in the future","Skip"
"It has already happened for many years and it happens now and it will continue to happen","Skip"
"So it's not some distant race war that anyone wishes for it is a deteriorating","Skip"
"Society that we're living in at the moment. So it's not something in the future. It is right now","Skip"
"You should be jacked right now. You should stop watching porn right now because it's bad for you","Bad Language"
"And it's nothing to do with our race war. It's about everything self-improvement goes into exactly everything we do","Skip"
"So we can talk about","Skip"
"demographics for example","Skip"
"These liberals they always say oh Europeans need to have more children if they don't we need to","Skip"
"Import a lot of people and then I say","Skip"
"Okay, listen to me","Skip"
"I can give you some good self-improvement advice so you can get our fair maid and it's not a family","Skip"
"So apparently that means I'm preparing for a race war","Skip"
"It doesn't make any sense at all","Skip"
"If I give diet advice if I give advice on how to become happier and more content or finding friends or finding a girl friend or whatever","Skip"
"That apparent demands in the twist and reality of this better left is journalists that I'm preparing for a race war","Skip"
"I'm saying that we are already involved in this war. It's not a race war","Skip"
"But it's a but it's a low intensity war between biocultures and civilizations","Hate Speech"
"That is where we are. I did not wish for this","Skip"
"I'm just trying to make the best out of a bad situation and I'm trying to give the best advice to those a comb to me to","Skip"
"gain good knowledge","Skip"
"So that's my response to this particular media lies. They will probably keep coming but as I said","Skip"
"I'm only happy to receive this","Skip"
"This type of attention because it's always the same. It's been the same for almost three years now","Skip"
"That's some one or some paper writes about me","Skip"
"People search on my name search the golden one on YouTube","Skip"
"Find my stuff and says oh, this isn't congruent with the version","Skip"
"They tried to portray him as this is a reasonable guy who wants the best for people","Skip"
"So yeah, thank you again to mainstream media keep writing. I will only get more subscribers","Skip"
"So thank you for watching Xxo boom","Skip"
"Hello everyone, this video is only allowed to be used as test data for the Delft Inclusive Speech Communication Lab Junction X Challenge.","Skip"
"Please delete this original recording by October 6 and do not share your data with others.","Skip"
"You definitely could save the demo video you made.","Skip"
"Please note the following content does not represent the view of anyone or any organization.","Skip"
"Thank you for your cooperation.","Skip"
"This evening, I cleaned up the kitchen and turned on the TV to listen to the news.","Skip"
"Recent news have discussed workplace pressures on women and the division of labour in the home.","Skip"
"This news made me recall what I heard a few days ago while watching short videos.","Skip"
"I saw someone say, women should stay home to take care of the children.","Hate Speech"
"And earning money is a man's job.","Hate Speech"
"ext","unified_label"
"complementing current programs to stop illegal drug entry","Skip"
"into the United States.","Skip"
"The sixth goal is primary.","Skip"
"We must expand public awareness and prevention.","Skip"
"And we've come a long way on this front.","Skip"
"Attitudes are changing.","Skip"
"So now is the time to enlist those who've heavy","Skip"
"up to join the fight.","Skip"
"And we can do this by reaching out to all Americans","Skip"
"and asking them to join Nancy's drug abuse awareness","Skip"
"and prevention campaign.","Skip"
"Taking a stand in every city, town and village in this country","Skip"
"and making certain drug users fully understand","Skip"
"their fellow citizens will no longer tolerate drug use.","Skip"
"Diseminating credible and accurate information","Skip"
"about the danger posed by drugs.","Skip"
"Users should know we're concerned and understand","Skip"
"there is a legitimate reason to be concerned.","Skip"
"In these next few weeks, the administration","Skip"
"will be preparing for an action campaign","Skip"
"based on many other points I've made here today","Skip"
"to be launched when the kids start returning","Skip"
"to school in the fall.","Skip"
"So this is chapter one, more to come.","Skip"
"Thank you.","Skip"
"Mr. President, do you know for a few years?","Skip"
"You said it anymore, but wait a minute.","Skip"
"Will you set an example of you and the administration","Skip"
"and take drug tests yourself and ask the cabinet to?","Skip"
"I've talked about that with the cabinet.","Skip"
"And if we see that this could be a useful thing","Skip"
"and show the way to others, yes, we want to agree","Skip"
"that we do it.","Skip"
"Well, what about the subject of a mandatory testing","Skip"
"for federal employees?","Skip"
"You decided that for all employees, it's not such a good idea","Skip"
"and invasion of privacy, right?","Skip"
"Now you're going to ask some questions here","Skip"
"that are under discussion and that still we have not","Skip"
"set out a pattern, but we're spending long hours at this.","Skip"
"But I could say this.","Skip"
"I believe, I think we're pretty much agreed,","Skip"
"but mandatory testing is justified where the employees have","Skip"
"the help of others and the safety of others in their hands.","Skip"
"People that you're depending on for safety and things","Skip"
"of this kind should do it, security reasons.","Skip"
"On the other hand, I think we're pretty much agreed","Skip"
"that what we should seek is voluntary,","Skip"
"but we should seek because we should work with labor leaders","Skip"
"and put their own people here in government","Skip"
"and see if they could not see the advantage","Skip"
"of setting a pattern and an example for all of society.","Skip"
"The question is, you wouldn't say anything today","Skip"
"about spending more federal money on drug enforcement.","Skip"
"And in fact, the level of spending","Skip"
"has remained current or go out down a little bit.","Skip"
"Is the rhetoric alone enough to take care of this?","Skip"
"It isn't just rhetoric alone.","Skip"
"We're talking about a lot of people","Skip"
"right now, organizations that are actively engaged","Skip"
"and so forth.","Skip"
"But let me say this.","Skip"
"No, we did step up as far as law enforcement was concerned.","Skip"
"That area.","Skip"
"There seems to be a little misunderstanding","Skip"
"about a reduction out here with regard to grants","Skip"
"and so forth about drug use and rehabilitation and so forth.","Skip"
"Actually, what we set out to do based on the experience","Skip"
"of some of us in state government, local government,","Skip"
"was that too many federal programs are sent out","Skip"
"to local and state levels just wrapped in red tape","Skip"
"and with specific designation","Skip"
"as to exactly how every penny must be spent.","Skip"
"And we found that that is led to a situation","Skip"
"in which many times the greatest part of the money","Skip"
"was used for administrative overhead","Skip"
"and not actually getting at the problem.","Skip"
"So what we did, yes, we reduced,","Skip"
"but we changed to block grants.","Skip"
"And we know from that experience out of the state level","Skip"
"that if you give a block grant and trust","Skip"
"to the local authorities, their freedom","Skip"
"to do this in the most expeditious manner","Skip"
"in their area treat with the problems","Skip"
"that they see as the greatest problem,","Skip"
"that you have more money actually going to the task","Skip"
"and not wasted in federal mandated overhead.","Skip"
"So if I can just follow up then you propose","Skip"
"to do what you outlined today","Skip"
"without spending any additional federal...","Skip"
"Oh no, no, we know that there's going to be a cost","Skip"
"and we're going to have to look at where we're going","Skip"
"to find that money because for example,","Skip"
"we believe that schools and workplaces,","Skip"
"we believe that we should, to those people","Skip"
"that are found to be using drugs","Skip"
"that if we don't threaten them with losing their jobs","Skip"
"or kicking them out of school,","Skip"
